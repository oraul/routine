# operation Specification (delta)

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The analyst decomposes and never implements
`agents/analyst.md` SHALL instruct: read the requirement's declared work
type and its `calibration/<type>.md` before decomposing; ground first
and record it — `grounding.md`'s evidence, alternatives, and assumptions
are written before the artifacts they justify; decompose the
requirement into briefings and tasks in the spec grammar (requirement
header, `Type:` declaration, RFC 2119 keywords, scenarios written as
Given/When/Then lines under `## Scenario: <label>` headings — the
labels the audit binds evidence to — enumerated acceptance, and a
non-empty caffeine manifest per task, with `testing/tdd` as the floor
when nothing domain-specific fits), shaped by the type's calibration;
revise against the full spec-lint defect list, continuing the same
conversation where it survives and re-grounding from `grounding.md`
where it does not; and never write implementation code or touch
script-owned state. It SHALL NOT restate individual lint rules outside
the grammar it teaches (stale restatements drift), SHALL state the
revise limit the way the gate counts it (per episode; a defect return
opens a fresh budget), and SHALL route missing caffeine vocabulary to
the human and `/caffeinate` — never an invented topic name. It SHALL name a `routine-*` script's frontmatter head (or `routine-manual`) as the contract to read before calling — never a recalled contract. Its re-entry sources SHALL include the ticket's `lint.log` alongside `grounding.md` and the `defect.md` files. Its grounding instruction SHALL describe Evidence bullets as claim-bearing — `- <path> — <what the file was found to contain or do>` — with the ruled-out form and the `- none — <why>` floors for Alternatives and Assumptions. Its re-entry rule SHALL be anchor-first: Evidence bullets are current when `Grounded-at` equals the target's current HEAD and the worktree is clean; otherwise only bullets whose paths the diff against the worktree (plus untracked files) names are re-verified, and the anchor is refreshed — never a full re-search. Its context handles SHALL be named: `TARGET`, the repository it grounds against, and `ROUTINE_TICKET_DIR`, where its artifacts land. It MAY use cheap read-only scouts to survey the target when the host provides delegation — scout prompts are transcript-only and never load-bearing; every accepted scout claim SHALL land as an Evidence bullet naming a real path, and unverified scout claims SHALL go under `## Assumptions` — however evidence is gathered, only the ticket artifacts are contract.

#### Scenario: Grammar named in the prompt
- **WHEN** the agent file is read
- **THEN** it names every grammar marker the linter enforces — including
  the type declaration, calibration loading, and the grounding record —
  and the never-implements rule

#### Scenario: Missing vocabulary goes to the human
- **WHEN** the agent file is read
- **THEN** it instructs referral to `/caffeinate` when no existing
  topic fits, instead of guessing a topic name

#### Scenario: The analyst consults the contract
- **WHEN** the agent file is read
- **THEN** it points at the script head or `routine-manual` for script
  contracts

#### Scenario: Re-entry reads the surviving defect list
- **WHEN** the agent file's re-entry section is read
- **THEN** it names lint.log among the files to read before re-deriving

#### Scenario: Evidence carries findings, not relevance
- **WHEN** the agent file's grounding output is read
- **THEN** it teaches the claim-bearing bullet form, the ruled-out
  form, and the non-empty floors

#### Scenario: Re-entry is anchor-first
- **WHEN** the agent file's re-entry section is read
- **THEN** it decides staleness by the Grounded-at anchor and re-verifies
  only diff-named and untracked paths

#### Scenario: Scout output is evidence or nothing
- **WHEN** the agent file is read
- **THEN** it admits read-only scouting with transcript-only prompts and
  routes accepted claims to Evidence bullets and unverified ones to
  Assumptions

#### Scenario: The analyst's handles are named
- **WHEN** the agent file is read
- **THEN** it names TARGET and ROUTINE_TICKET_DIR as its context
  handles
