# operation Specification (delta)

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The analyst decomposes and never implements
`agents/analyst.md` SHALL instruct: read the requirement's declared work
type and its `calibration/<type>.md` before decomposing; ground first
and record it — `grounding.md`'s evidence, alternatives, and assumptions
are written before the artifacts they justify; decompose the
requirement into briefings and tasks in the spec grammar (requirement
header, `Type:` declaration, RFC 2119 keywords, scenarios written as
Given/When/Then lines under `## Scenario: <label>` headings — the
labels the audit binds evidence to — enumerated acceptance, and a
non-empty caffeine manifest per task, with `testing/tdd` as the floor
when nothing domain-specific fits), shaped by the type's calibration;
revise against the full spec-lint defect list, continuing the same
conversation where it survives and re-grounding from `grounding.md`
where it does not; and never write implementation code or touch
script-owned state. It SHALL NOT restate individual lint rules outside
the grammar it teaches (stale restatements drift), SHALL state the
revise limit the way the gate counts it (per episode; a defect return
opens a fresh budget), and SHALL route missing caffeine vocabulary to
the human and `/caffeinate` — never an invented topic name.

#### Scenario: Grammar named in the prompt
- **WHEN** the agent file is read
- **THEN** it names every grammar marker the linter enforces — including
  the type declaration, calibration loading, and the grounding record —
  and the never-implements rule

#### Scenario: Missing vocabulary goes to the human
- **WHEN** the agent file is read
- **THEN** it instructs referral to `/caffeinate` when no existing
  topic fits, instead of guessing a topic name

### Requirement: The developer is stateless and evidence-bound
`agents/developer.md` SHALL instruct: consume exactly one task from
`routine-next`; context is the task file, the requirement's typed
contract section (`## Reproduction`/`## Touchpoints`/`## Contracts`/
`## Order` — the type's evidence, nothing else from the requirement),
the caffeine docs named in that task's own `## Caffeine` manifest, the
ticket's `calibration/<type>.md`, block/unblock files when present, and
the two handles every scripted call needs — the ticket directory
(`ROUTINE_TICKET_DIR`, the `<ticket-dir>` argument of the refusal
scripts) and the target root (`TARGET`) — nothing else. It SHALL state
the precedence when sources conflict (task > target conventions >
calibration > caffeine; earlier manifest topic first among caffeine
docs), SHALL record TDD evidence under the task's own
`## Scenario: <label>` headings — the label verbatim as the scenario
string, red and green bound to the identical label and identical
command (the audit demands a covering green per label and pairs the
evidence byte-exact) — with characterization tests kept out of the TDD
evidence, SHALL bound the developer-gate loop with an off-ramp
(repeated gate failures or a fix that leaves the task's scope route to
the scripted refusals, never an unbounded retry), SHALL return a
defective spec by calling `routine-defect <ticket-dir> <reason>`
instead of improvising, and on blockage SHALL write `block.md` and call
`routine-block`. The Never list SHALL cover script-owned state, other
tasks, out-of-manifest caffeine, `runs/<app>/hooks/*`, and calling
`routine-done` (the protocol driver's move, not the developer's).

#### Scenario: Statelessness named in the prompt
- **WHEN** the agent file is read
- **THEN** it names the one-task rule, the closed context list including
  the calibration doc, the scripted defect return, and the block procedure

#### Scenario: The context list matches what the scripts demand
- **WHEN** the agent file is read
- **THEN** the closed list admits `ROUTINE_TICKET_DIR`, `TARGET`, and
  the requirement's typed contract section, and states the precedence
  ladder

#### Scenario: The gate loop has a floor
- **WHEN** the developer gate keeps failing or the fix would leave the
  task's scope
- **THEN** the agent file routes to `routine-defect` or `routine-block`,
  never an unbounded retry

#### Scenario: Evidence carries the task's labels
- **WHEN** the agent file is read
- **THEN** it instructs recording red and green under the task's
  `## Scenario: <label>` headings verbatim
